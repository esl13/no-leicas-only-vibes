            <p> I'm a data analyst based out of New York City. The best part about my job is that I get to tell people every day why pie charts are dumb.</p>
            <p>I'm also film photography enthusiast. My three main cameras are the Yashica Mat-124G, Nikon S3, and Contax TVS. I'm also a practitioner of kendo, the Japanese way of the sword. </p>
